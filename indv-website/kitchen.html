        <p>Fire extinguishers: These are a must in the kitchen. Don’t forget it. Just any fire extinguisher is not enough. Don’t just buy a fire extinguisher. Talk to the Experts. At Lucama we help you find the right extinguisher. </p>
     
        <p>There are three types of extinguishers for the kitchen
Every household extinguisher is labeled A, B, or C, which tells you the types of fires the extinguisher is effective against. A is ordinary combustibles like wood, paper, and cloth; B is flammable liquids, such as gasoline or cooking oil; and C is live electricity.</p>
       
<h3>Which size is right?</h3>
   <br>  
<p>10-pound:(insert image) Best for: Garage or home workshop, where a fire might grow before being noticed. Look for: Rechargeable model with hose for ease of use.</p>
<p>5-pound:(insert image) Best for: Quick grab in the kitchen or laundry room. Look for: Rechargeable model with hose for ease of use.</p>
<p>2-pound (insert Picture) Best for: Car. Look for: Disposable model with mounting hardware to keep it from rolling around in the trunk.</p>
<p>Stove-top:(insert picture) Best for: Mounting on range hood over stove. (Do not use over deep fryers; released chemical can splash grease and spread flames.) Look for: Magnetic pressurized cans designed to pop open from the heat of flames, spraying sodium bicarbonate (baking soda).</p>

    <h3>What to do to be safe.</h3>
      
    <br>
        <p>Did you know the kitchen is where more home fires occur than anywhere else in the house and that cooking is the number one cause of home fires? The American Red Cross has steps everyone can follow to avoid a cooking fire: </p>
            <br/>

<ul>
    <li><p align ="center">	Never leave cooking food unattended – stay in the kitchen when frying, grilling or broiling food. If you have to leave the kitchen, even for a second, turn off the stove.<p/></li>

	<li><p align ="center">Check your food regularly while cooking and remain in the home while cooking.</p></li>

    <li><p align ="center">Use a timer so you’ll remember that the stove or oven is on.</p></li>

    <li><p align ="center">Don’t wear loose clothing or dangling sleeves while cooking.</p></li>	

	<li><p align ="center">Keep the kids away from the cooking area. Enforce a “kid-free zone” and make them stay at least three feet away from the stove.</p></li>

    <li><p align ="center">Keep anything that can catch fire - pot holders, oven mitts, wooden utensils, paper or plastic bags, food packaging, and towels or curtains—away from your stove, oven or any other appliance in the kitchen that generates heat.</p></li>

    <li><p align ="center">Clean cooking surfaces on a regular basis to prevent grease buildup.</p></li>	

    <li><p align ="center">Consider purchasing a fire extinguisher to keep in your kitchen. Contact your local fire department to take training on the proper use of extinguishers.</p></li>

    <li><p align ="center">Always check the kitchen before going to bed or leaving the home to make sure all stoves, ovens, and small appliances are turned off.</p></li>

    <li><p align ="center">	Install a smoke alarm near your kitchen, on each level of your home, near sleeping areas, and inside and outside bedrooms if you sleep with doors closed. Use the test button to check it each month. Replace all batteries at least once a year.</p></li>
