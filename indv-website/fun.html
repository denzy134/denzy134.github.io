            <li><p align ="left"> The first patented fire extinguisher was invented by Ambrose Godfrey, a German chemist, in 1723 in England, and used gunpowder and fuses for expelling the liquid.</p></li>
            <li><p align ="left"> In the Middle Ages, 'squirts' were first used. Applying jets of water to fires worked very similar to a bike pump, dipping the nozzle in water, sucking up one litre of water by pulling a plunger. Squirts were used on the 1666 Great Fire of London.</p></li>
<li><p align ="left"> The first portable fire extinguisher, was invented by Captain George William Manby, a British Captain and Inventor in 1818. Made of a copper container filled with potassium carbonate and pressurised air. It was called the "Extincteur".</p></li>
 <li><p align ="left"> Around 1912 Pyrene pioneered the carbon tetrachloride or CTC extinguisher, where the liquid was expelled from a brass or chrome container by hand pump, onto a fire. This was highly toxic and sometimes even deaths occurred from using these extinguishers in confined spaces.</p></li>           
<li><p align ="left"> The biggest extinguisher in the world, made by Hungarian engineers, is called the "big wind". They removed gun turrets from an old Russian tank, replaced them with 2 turbines from a MiG-21 fighter jet.</p></li>
<li><p align ="left">It's 27,000 pounds, 4591 cubic feet per second of air travelling 770 miles per hour. 8000 gallons of water per minute!</p></li>

        <li><p align ="left"> Extinguishers have become quite the fashion statement! Many people have recycled old extinguishers into furniture like lamps, tables even BBQ grilles.</p></li>
       <li><p align ="left">However, the most famous extinguisher art is by Niclas Castello. His designer extinguishers are sold to the Hollywood elite, including Beyonc√© and Jay-Z having these designer extinguishers in their $95 million Beverly Hills mansion! But they are available to the public with a price tag of $9000 minimum!</p></li>
