    <h3> Overrated i know!!!</h3>
   <aside> <h2> DID YOU KNOW ????</h2>   
    
    
    <p> Metal cylinders are time bombs ready to explode at any time with a significant amount of heat present in the Kitchen. A gas leakage would necsesarily not kill your kids but an explosion would definetly do it.</p>
    <p> Explosions in the kitchen is mainly due to leakages in metal cylinders and hoses.</p>
       
    <p> Metal cylinders have an expiry date. Ohhhhh yeah!! They do!! Do you prefer eating expired products to fresh foods. </p> 
       <p> If you dont know that, metal cylinders are defintely not right for you. Maybe you would want to change it after a few years but why would ypu want to spend all that money when you can get a fibre cylinder for a lifetime. Its your call</p>
