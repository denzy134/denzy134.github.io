    <p>Have you ever been at work and left your kids at home and remembered that the kitchen was open to them? Yeah it frightens you. They could turn on the gas and probably just inhale it. You might just come back to meet dead kids. </p>
           
<!--        </div>-->
    <h3>Thatâ€™s pretty scary!!!</h3>
    
    <h3> Overrated i know!!!</h3>
    <h2> DID YOU KNOW ????</h2>   
    
    
    <p> Metal cylinders are time bombs ready to explode at any time with a significant amount of heat present in the Kitchen. A gas leakage would necsesarily not kill your kids but an explosion would definetly do it.</p>
    <p> Explosions in the kitchen is mainly due to leakages in metal cylinders and hoses.</p>
       
    <p> Metal cylinders have an expiry date. Ohhhhh yeah!! They do!! Do you prefer eating expired products to fresh foods. </p> 
       <p> If you dont know that, metal cylinders are defintely not right for you. Maybe you would want to change it after a few years but why would ypu want to spend all that money when you can get a fibre cylinder for a lifetime. Its your call</p>
    
    <p> Here at LUKAMA we think about you and your family. Kitchen Explosions can wipe out an entire family......</p>
